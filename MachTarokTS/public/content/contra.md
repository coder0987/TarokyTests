# Moving Up the Ranks - Calling Contra

Contra is one of the most underused ways of gaining a competitive advantage in Taroky, especially in a tournament setting.  
Roughly 20% of the time, contra is the best option.  
Yet most players go through 6 hour tournaments with at most one contra.  
Lets take a look at why.

## Contra is Risky

Contra doubles the stakes.  
Worse yet, a misjudged hand could be hit with a rhea-contra, doubling the stakes again.  
A hand which can win but isn’t guaranteed typically doesn’t result in a contra.  

## Prever Pays Better

A hand which is powerful enough to contra is usually powerful enough to go prever.  
Prever gets 4.5 times the chips, as opposed to only double (three players instead of one, triple instead of double during counting).  
Prever is much riskier, but extremely powerful hands will always call prever rather than contra.  
Veteran players will tell you, the number of hands that can win a contra is very small because prever is almost always a better option.  

## The Contra Advantage

Because of its scarcity, contra can be a powerful tool to gain an edge, especially in a tournament setting.  
Someone who contras regularly (if they win) will make far more chips than another player with the same hands who never (or only very rarely) calls contra.  
Contra also allows you to see what point cards your opponents (and partner!) have before committing to the risk.  
If another player calls bida or uni and you don’t have the trump to carry them, you can bail out before calling contra.  
Anyone who has called prever against bida knows that the same isn’t true for prever.
